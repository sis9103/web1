  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>
    The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system
    where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
    (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext,
    and are accessible over the Internet.[1]
    The resources of the WWW may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser.
